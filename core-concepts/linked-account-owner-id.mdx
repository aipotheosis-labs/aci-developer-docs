The Linked Account Owner ID is a unique identifier that:

- Identifies the end-user who owns the linked account
- Is provided by you when linking an account or executing functions
- Allows you to associate external service accounts with your own user system
- Is unique per App per project
- Enables your agents to act on behalf of specific users when executing functions

<Warning>
  You determine the Linked Account Owner ID value. It can be a user ID from your system, an email address, or any other identifier that helps you track which end-user the linked account belongs to. When executing functions, you must provide this ID so the platform knows which credentials to use.
