An `App Configuration` is created when you enable and configure an `App` for your `Project`. It represents:

- The connection between your `Project` and a specific `App`
- The security scheme you've chosen for that `App` (OAuth2, API Key, etc.)
- Any custom settings or overrides for the `App`'s security configuration

<Note>
  You MUST create an `App Configuration` before your AI agents can use an `App`. Each `Project` can have one configuration per `App`, allowing you to control which `Apps` and `Functions` are accessible within that `Project`.
