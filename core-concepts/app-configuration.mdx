An `App Configuration` is created when you configure an `App` under a `Project`. It is a project-specific integration setting for a third-party service (an App) in the ACI platform. It represents:

</Frame>

- **Integration Record**: The formal relationship between your Project and a specific App (like GitHub, Google Calendar, etc.)
- **Authentication Strategy**: The selected security scheme (`OAuth2`, `API Key`, `No Auth`) used for authenticating with the App
- **Security Overrides**: Custom authentication parameters that override default App settings (e.g., client IDs, secrets)
- **Function Access Control**: Which specific functions from the App are enabled for use in your Project
- **Linked Accounts Management**: Serves as the parent configuration for all individual user accounts connected to this App

Each Project can configure multiple Apps, but only one configuration per App is allowed to maintain simplicity. App Configurations are prerequisites for using any third-party service with your AI agents and are managed through the ACI Developer Portal.

## Authentication Types
Each App may support one or more authentication types. You need to select one that works for your use case when creating an `App Configuration`.

All the `Linked Accounts` under the `App Configuration` will use the same authentication type.

- **OAuth2**: The most common authentication type for third-party services, e.g.: Gmail
- **API Key**: A simple authentication method that uses an API key to authenticate requests, e.g.: Brave Search
- **No Auth**: Some apps do not require additional authentication, e.g.: Arxiv, Hackernews

<Note>
  You MUST create an `App Configuration` before your AI agents can use an `App`. Each `Project` can have one configuration per `App`, allowing you to control which `Apps` and `Functions` are accessible within that `Project`.
</Note>

## Custom OAuth2 App Support

You can use your **own OAuth2 client** instead of ACI.dev's default app when integrating with providers offering `oauth2` Authentication Method.

### Why use a custom OAuth2 app?

<Warning>
  **White-labelling effect**
  
  If you use the default ACI.dev app, users will see our branding (name, logo) on the OAuth2 consent screen.
  
  By using **your own OAuth2 client**, your branding is shown — improving user trust and maintaining a consistent experience.
</Warning>

**Benefits:**

* Your **name and logo** on consent screens
* Full control over app access, quotas, and audit history
* Avoids ACI.dev attribution in user-facing flows

### How to configure your own OAuth2 app

1. **Create an OAuth2 client** in your provider's developer portal.

2. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and paste them into the fields shown in the UI.

3. Add the following to your OAuth2 app settings:

   * **Redirect URL**

     ```markdown
     https://api.aci.dev/v1/linked-accounts/oauth2/callback
     ```

   * **Scope**

     ```markdown
     https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets
     ```

4. ✅ Confirm both the redirect URL and scope exactly match the values provided in the interface.

<Warning>
  **You cannot change the OAuth2 client after setup.**
  
  If you need to update it, you must **delete and reconfigure the app** from scratch.
