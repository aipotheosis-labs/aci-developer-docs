The Aipolabs ACI [Python SDK](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aipolabs-python) offers a convenient way to access the Aipolabs ACI REST API from any Python 3.10+ application.

In most cases, you should use the SDK to interact with our system programmatically unless you have a specific reason to call the API directly.

Both the SDK and API are currently in beta, so breaking changes may occur.

<Note>
SDKs for additional languages are coming soon. If you're interested in contributing to our open-source SDKs, please [reach out](mailto:support@aipolabs.xyz)!
</Note>

## Usage
Aipolabs platform is built with agent-first principles. Although you can call each of the APIs below any way you prefer in your application, we strongly recommend trying the Agent-centric features and taking a look at the examples to get the most out of the platform and to enable the full potential and vision of future agentic applications.

## Client
```
from aipolabs import Aipolabs

client = Aipolabs(
    # it reads from environment variable by default so you can omit it if you set it in your environment
    api_key=os.environ.get("AIPOLABS_API_KEY")
)
```

## Apps
### Types
```
from aipolabs.types.apps import App, AppDetails
```

### Methods
```
# search for apps, returns list of basic app data, sorted by relevance to the intent
# all parameters are optional
apps: list[App] = client.apps.search(
    intent="I want to search the web",
    configured_only=True,
    categories=["search"],
    limit=10,
    offset=0
)
```
```
# get detailed information about an app, including functions supported by the app
app_details: AppDetails = client.apps.get(app_name="BRAVE_SEARCH")
```

## Functions
### Types
```
from aipolabs.types.functions import Function, FunctionExecutionResult, InferenceProvider
```

### Methods
```
# search for functions, returns list of basic function data, sorted by relevance to the intent
# all parameters are optional
functions: list[Function] = client.functions.search(
    app_names=["BRAVE_SEARCH", "TAVILY"],
    intent="I want to search the web",
    configured_only=True,
    limit=10,
    offset=0
)
```
```
# get function definition of a specific function, this is the schema you can feed into LLM
# the actual format is defined by the inference provider
function_definition: dict = client.functions.get_definition(
    function_name="BRAVE_SEARCH__WEB_SEARCH",
    inference_provider=InferenceProvider.OPENAI
)
```
```
# execute a function with the provided parameters
result: FunctionExecutionResult = client.functions.execute(
    function_name="BRAVE_SEARCH__WEB_SEARCH",
    function_parameters={"query": {"q": "what is the weather in barcelona"}},
    linked_account_owner_id="john_doe"
)

if result.success:
    print(result.data)
else:
    print(result.error)
```
