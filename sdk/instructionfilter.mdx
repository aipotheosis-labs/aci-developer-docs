### Overview

Through our [developer portal](https://platform.aci.dev) we allow developers to set filters for configured apps which limit their functionality. For example,

| App            | Filter                                                                             |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BRAVE_SEARCH` | Perform search only if the query does not mention any violent incidents.           |
| `GITHUB`       | Only access repositories related to backend technologies, not frontend frameworks. |
| `GMAIL`        | Do not send emails to unlucky@server.com.                                          |

Before a function is executed in our *Unified Function Calling Handler* we check whether the function arguments violate the instruction filter, and correspondingly whether the function should be executed.

<Note>
  Currently instruction filters are added at the App level, in future releases we plan to offer it at the Function level.
