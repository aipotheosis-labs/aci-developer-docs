!TODO: Hanyi to update anything about meta functions in general

## Agent-centric features
The SDK provides a suite of features and helper functions to make it easier and more seamless to use functions in LLM powered agentic applications. This is our vision and the recommended way of trying out the SDK.

Meta Functions and Unified Function Calling Handler
We provide 4 meta functions that can be used with LLMs as tools directly, and a unified handler for function calls. With these the LLM can discover apps and functions (that our platform supports) and execute them autonomously.

```
from aipolabs import meta_functions

# meta functions
tools = [
    meta_functions.AipolabsSearchApps.SCHEMA,
    meta_functions.AipolabsSearchFunctions.SCHEMA,
    meta_functions.AipolabsGetFunctionDefinition.SCHEMA,
    meta_functions.AipolabsExecuteFunction.SCHEMA,
]
```
```
# unified function calling handler
result = client.handle_function_call(
    tool_call.function.name,
    json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments),
    linked_account_owner_id="john_doe",
    configured_only=True,
    inference_provider=InferenceProvider.OPENAI
)
```
