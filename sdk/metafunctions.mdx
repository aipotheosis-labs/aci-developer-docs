Beyond the standard wrapper around the Aipolabs ACI APIs,, the SDK provides a suite of features and helper functions to make it easier and more seamless to use functions in LLM powered agentic applications. This is our vision and the recommended way of trying out the SDK in agentic applications.

One key feature is the set of meta function schemas we provide.
Essentially, they are just the json schema version of some of the backend APIs of ACI.dev. They are provided so that your LLM/Agent can utlize some of the features of ACI.dev directly via [function (tool) calling <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).

```
from aipolabs import meta_functions

# meta functions
tools = [
    meta_functions.ACISearchApps.SCHEMA,
    meta_functions.ACISearchFunctions.SCHEMA,
    meta_functions.ACIGetFunctionDefinition.SCHEMA,
    meta_functions.ACIExecuteFunction.SCHEMA,
]
```
These meta functions differ from the direct function (tool) calls you might typically execute—such as **GITHUB__LIST_STARGAZERS** — in that they are specifically tailored for use by large language models (LLMs) to interact with ACI.dev backend APIs.

<Note>
  Technically, you can also write your own meta functions around the ACI.dev backend APIs. After getting the input arguments generated by the LLM, you can use the SDK to send the request to the backend APIs with the input arguments.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ACI Search Apps" icon="function">
  - It's the json schema version of the `/v1/apps` endpoint and `aci.apps.search` function in SDK.
  - It's used to search for integrated apps (e.g. `GITHUB`, `GMAIL`, `BRAVE_SEARCH`) in ACI.dev.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="ACI Search Functions" icon="function">
  - It's the json schema version of the `/v1/functions` endpoint and `aci.functions.search` function in SDK.
  - It's used to search for integrated functions (e.g. `GITHUB__STAR_REPOSITORY`, `GMAIL__SEND_EMAIL`, `BRAVE_SEARCH__WEB_SEARCH`) in ACI.dev.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="ACI Get Function Definition" icon="function">
  - It's the json schema version of the `/v1/functions/{function_name}/definition` endpoint and `aci.functions.get_definition` function in SDK.
  - It's used to get the LLM-compatible json schema of an integrated function (e.g. `GITHUB__STAR_REPOSITORY`, `GMAIL__SEND_EMAIL`, `BRAVE_SEARCH__WEB_SEARCH`) in ACI.dev.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="ACI Execute Function" icon="function">
  - It's the json schema version of the `/v1/functions/{function_name}/execute` endpoint and `aci.functions.execute` function in SDK.
  - It's used to execute a function (e.g. `GITHUB__STAR_REPOSITORY`, `GMAIL__SEND_EMAIL`, `BRAVE_SEARCH__WEB_SEARCH`) in ACI.dev.

Together with our **Unified Function Calling Handler**, it offer a powerful, self-discovery mechanism for LLM-driven applications, enabling them to autonomously select, interpret, and execute functions based on the context of a given task or conversation.
```
# unified function calling handler
result = client.handle_function_call(
    tool_call.function.name,
    json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments),
    linked_account_owner_id="john_doe",
    allowed_apps_only=True,
    format=FunctionDefinitionFormat.OPENAI
)
```
