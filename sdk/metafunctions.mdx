## Agent-centric features
The SDK provides a suite of features and helper functions to make it easier and more seamless to use functions in LLM powered agentic applications. This is our vision and the recommended way of trying out the SDK.

Meta Functions and Unified Function Calling Handler
We provide 4 meta functions that can be used with LLMs as tools directly, and a unified handler for function calls. With these the LLM can discover apps and functions (that our platform supports) and execute them autonomously.

```
from aipolabs import meta_functions

# meta functions
tools = [
    meta_functions.AipolabsSearchApps.SCHEMA,
    meta_functions.AipolabsSearchFunctions.SCHEMA,
    meta_functions.AipolabsGetFunctionDefinition.SCHEMA,
    meta_functions.AipolabsExecuteFunction.SCHEMA,
]
```
```
# unified function calling handler
result = client.handle_function_call(
    tool_call.function.name,
    json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments),
    linked_account_owner_id="john_doe",
    configured_only=True,
    inference_provider=InferenceProvider.OPENAI
)
```
There are mainly two ways to use the platform with the meta functions:

- **Fully Autonomous**: Provide all 4 meta functions to the LLM, please see the agent_with_dynamic_function_discovery_and_fixed_tools.py for more details.
- **Semi Autonomous**: Provide all but AipolabsExecuteFunction to the LLM, and use the Unified Function Calling Handler to execute functions, please see the agent_with_dynamic_function_discovery_and_dynamic_tools.py for more details.

Please also see agent_with_preplanned_tools.py for comparison where the specific functions are pre selected and provided to the LLM.
