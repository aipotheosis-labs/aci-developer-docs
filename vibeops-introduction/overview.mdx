VibeOps is a platform that abstracts away the complexity of DevOps, letting you build and deploy full-stack web applications through natural language conversations with AI, right from your IDE.

# Getting Started with VibeOps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit VibeOps Platform">
    Navigate to [VibeOps <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://vibeops.aci.dev/) and sign in with your Google account.
    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Your First Project">
    On the main dashboard, you'll see "No projects yet" if this is your first time. Click the **Create Project** button to get started.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/vibeops/create-project-dialog.png" alt="Create New Project Dialog" />
    </Frame>
    
    In the project creation dialog:
    - Enter a **Project Name** (e.g., "Todo App")
    - Optionally add a **Description** for your project
    - Click **Create Project** to continue
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure MCP (Model Context Protocol)">
    After creating your project, you'll see the MCP configuration screen with everything you need to connect your project to Cursor.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/vibeops/mcp-configuration.png" alt="MCP Configuration Screen with API key and setup instructions" />
    </Frame>
    
    ### 1. Install UV Package Manager
    First, you need to install UV since the MCP server uses `uvx` to execute. Run this command in your terminal:
    
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
    
    After installation, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `source ~/.zshrc` for zsh) to ensure `uvx` is available in your PATH.
    
    ### 2. Copy Configuration for Your IDE
    **Copy the complete JSON configuration shown on the VibeOps screen and save it.** You'll use this configuration in the next step to connect Cursor to your VibeOps project.
    
    <Note>
      Don't worry if you lose the configuration - you can always retrieve it later from inside your project settings.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Cursor MCP Integration">
    Now you need to add this configuration to Cursor:
    
    1. Open **Cursor Settings** with **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + J**
    2. Select the **MCP** tab
    3. Click on **+ Add new global MCP server**
     <Frame>
      <img src="/images/vibeops/cursor-settings-mcp-tab.png" alt="Cursor Settings showing the MCP tab" />
    </Frame> 
    4. Paste the JSON configuration from before and it should look like the following but with your api key
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/vibeops/cursor-add-mcp-server.png" alt="Cursor Add new global MCP server dialog" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the Connection">
    Navigating back to your MCP settings you should see your new connection it should look something like this
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/vibeops/cursor-mcp-tools.png" alt="Cursor MCP Settings showing the configured VibeOps server" />
    </Frame>
    
    <Note>
      You may need to click the refresh button for the MCP server to work
    </Note>
    
    The available tools should include:
    - `ACI_SEARCH_FUNCTIONS` - Search for available functions
    - `ACI_EXECUTE_FUNCTION` - Execute functions on your behalf  
    - `ACI_GET_PROJECT_STATE` - Get current project status
    
    ### Enable Seamless Development
    Through **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + J** and then navigating to **Features**, you can enable the following option:
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/vibeops/cursor-mcp-enabled-feature.png" alt="MCP feature enabled for seamless development" />
    </Frame>
    
    <Tip>
      **We recommend enabling this feature for seamless development.** This will allow VibeOps to work more efficiently with your development workflow and provide a smoother experience when building applications.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>
