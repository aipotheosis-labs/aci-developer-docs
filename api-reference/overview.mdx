description: 'The Aipolabs ACI API powers the ACI platform and SDK offered by Aipolabs.'
---

<Note>
  Most of the time, you wonâ€™t need to interact with the API directly. Instead, you should use our system through either [platform](platform.aci.dev) or [SDK](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aipolabs-python). 
</Note>

<Note>
  Our [SDK](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aipolabs-python) interacts with these APIs under the hood, but provide additional agent-centric features specifically designed for LLM-based agents.
</Note>

## Authentication
For programmatic access, the API supports API key-based authentication. You can generate an API key by creating an agent on Aipolabs ACI [platform](platform.aci.dev).
You can then provide this API key to SDK environment variable or set it in X-API-KEY header if you are calling API directly.

Once obtained, you can provide this API key as an environment variable for the SDK or include it in the `X-API-KEY` header when calling the API directly.

## Quota & Rate limiting

During the beta period, all API calls are subject to a capped quota and rate limits. Currently, we allow up to 20 API calls per second and a total quota of 5,000 API calls per project per day.

<Note>
These limits are subject to change. If you have a use case that requires higher limits, please [contact us](mailto:support@aipolabs.xyz).
