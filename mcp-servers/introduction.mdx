## Overview
ACI.dev provides two Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that give LLMs access to a wide range of external functions and tools.
The codebase is open source and can be found here: [aipolabs-mcp](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aipolabs-mcp).


## Two Types of MCP Servers
- **Apps MCP Server**: This server is similar to most of the existing MCP servers out there, where it exposes a set of functions from a specific app (e.g., Gmail, Github, etc.). However, our `Apps MCP Server` allows you to include multiple apps in a single server.
- **Unified MCP Server**: This server is a dynamic server that provides two meta functions (tools) to discover and execute ANY functions (tools) available on ACI.dev platform.

For pros and cons of each server, please refer to the individual sections.


## Prerequisites

Before using either MCP server, you need to complete several setup steps on the ACI.dev platform:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your ACI.dev API Key">
    You'll need an API key from one of your ACI.dev agents. Find this in your [project settings](https://platform.aci.dev/project-settings)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Apps">
    Navigate to the [App Store](https://platform.aci.dev/apps) to configure the apps you want to use with your MCP servers.
    <Note>
      For more details on what is an app and how to configure it, please refer to the [App](../core-concepts/app) section.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Allowed Apps">
    In your [Project Settings](https://platform.aci.dev/project-settings), enable the apps you want your agent to access by adding them to the `Allowed Apps` list.
    <Note>
      For more details on how and why to set allowed apps, please refer to the [Agent](../core-concepts/agent) section.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link Accounts For Each App">
    For each app you want to use, you'll need to link end-user (or your own) accounts. During account linking, you'll specify a `linked-account-owner-id` which you'll later provide when starting the MCP servers.
    <Note>
      For more details on how to link accounts and what `linked-account-owner-id` is, please refer to the [Linked Accounts](../core-concepts/linked-account) section.
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Package">
    ```bash
    # Install uv if you don't have it already
    curl -sSf https://install.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3 -
    pip install uv
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Environment Variables

Set the following environment variable before running either MCP server:

```bash
export AIPOLABS_ACI_API_KEY=your_aci_api_key
```

## Next Steps

Choose the MCP server that best fits your needs and follow the instructions in the respective sections.
