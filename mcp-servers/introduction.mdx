## Overview
Apart from using ACI.dev's Apps/Functions (tools) directly via LLM function (tool) calls, we also provide two types of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that allow your MCP clients to access all Apps/Functions (tools) available on ACI.dev platform.
The codebase is open source and can be found here: [aipolabs-mcp <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aipolabs-mcp).


## Two Types of MCP Servers
- **Apps MCP Server**: This server is similar to most of the existing MCP servers out there, where it exposes a set of functions from a specific app (e.g., Gmail, Github, etc.). However, our `Apps MCP Server` allows you to include multiple apps in a single server.
- **Unified MCP Server**: This server is a dynamic server that provides two meta functions (tools) to discover and execute ANY functions (tools) available on ACI.dev platform.

For pros and cons of each server, please refer to the individual sections.



## Next Steps

Choose the MCP server that best fits your needs and follow the instructions in the respective sections.
