## Overview

The Unified MCP Server provides a smart, scalable approach to function calling by exposing just two meta functions (tools) that can:
1. Dynamically discover the right functions (tools) based on user intent
2. Execute any function on the ACI.dev platform retrieved from the search results


## How It Works


The `Unified MCP Server` exposes two meta-functions:

1. `ACI_SEARCH_FUNCTIONS` - Discovers functions based on your intent/needs
2. `ACI_EXECUTE_FUNCTION` - Executes any function discovered by the search

This approach allows LLMs to first search for the right tool based on the user's needs and then execute it, without needing to list all available functions upfront.



## Benefits

- **Reduced Context Window Usage** - Instead of loading hundreds of function definitions into your LLM's context window, the unified server keeps it minimal with just two functions (tools)
- **Dynamic Discovery** - The server intelligently finds the most relevant tools for your specific task
- **Complete Function Coverage** - Access to ALL functions on the ACI.dev platform without configuration changes
- **Simplified Integration** - No need to manage multiple MCP servers for different apps or groups of functions (tools)

## Prerequisites

Before using the `Unified MCP Server`, you need to complete several setup steps on the ACI.dev platform.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your ACI.dev API Key">
    You'll need an API key from one of your ACI.dev agents. Find this in your [project setting <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://platform.aci.dev/project-setting)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Apps">
    Navigate to the [App Store <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://platform.aci.dev/apps) to configure the apps you want to use with your MCP servers.
    <Note>
      For more details on what is an app and how to configure it, please refer to the [App](../core-concepts/app) section.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Allowed Apps">
    In your [Project Setting <Icon icon="up-right-from-square"/>](https://platform.aci.dev/project-setting), enable the apps you want your agent to access by adding them to the `Allowed Apps` list.
    <Note>
      For more details on how and why to set allowed apps, please refer to the [Agent](../core-concepts/agent) section.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link Accounts For Each App">
    For each app you want to use, you'll need to link end-user (or your own) accounts. During account linking, you'll specify a `linked-account-owner-id` which you'll later provide when starting the MCP servers.
    <Note>
      For more details on how to link accounts and what `linked-account-owner-id` is, please refer to the [Linked Accounts](../core-concepts/linked-account) section.
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Package">
    ```bash
    # Install uv if you don't have it already
    curl -sSf https://install.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3 -
    pip install uv
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Integration with MCP Clients
